# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-28)

**Core value:** Visual, spatially-aware asset tracking with calibrated measurements that makes equipment location and details instantly accessible.

**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Location Hierarchy & Categories

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 7 (Location Hierarchy & Categories)
Plan: 3 of TBD in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-01 - Completed 02-03-PLAN.md (Visual Location Hierarchy)

Progress: [████████░░] 75%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 16 min
- Total execution time: 2.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 5 | 23min | 5min |
| 02 | 3 | 97min | 32min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4min, 4min, 22min, 14min, 61min
- Trend: Phase 2 UI components take longer due to complex integration (MUI, dialogs, service wiring)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: SQLite for v1 database (single-file, portable, cloud-sync friendly, zero server setup)
- Phase 1: Abstracted data access layer (enable future migration to client-server architecture)
- Phase 1: Two-point calibration for floor plans (accurate real-world measurements)
- Phase 1: Hierarchical location model (matches physical reality and organizational structure)
- Plan 01-01: Manually scaffolded Tauri 2 (create-tauri-app CLI issues)
- Plan 01-01: TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety
- Plan 01-01: Clean architecture structure from start (prevents mixing concerns)
- Plan 01-02: Zod schemas with safeParse factory pattern (type-safe runtime validation)
- Plan 01-02: Silent coordinate clamping (0.0-1.0) handles floating point edge cases gracefully
- Plan 01-02: Immutable entities with private data and getters (enforces controlled updates through repository)
- Plan 01-03: Normalized coordinates as REAL type in schema (0.0-1.0 range for viewport independence)
- Plan 01-03: WAL mode enabled by default (better concurrency and corruption resistance)
- Plan 01-03: Cascade delete strategy for hierarchical data cleanup
- Plan 01-04: Repository interfaces define framework-agnostic contracts for future database migration
- Plan 01-04: Factory pattern with lazy initialization and singleton for efficient repository access
- Plan 01-04: Domain entity mapping in repositories enforces validation at persistence boundary
- Plan 01-04: Type casting for enum filters in Drizzle queries to satisfy TypeScript strict mode
- Plan 01-05: Pixel coordinates rounded to nearest integer for rendering precision
- Plan 01-05: Cloud folder detection via environment variables + path patterns (OneDrive, Dropbox, SharePoint, Google Drive)
- Plan 01-05: Session-based warning tracking prevents repetitive nagging
- Plan 01-05: File storage uses relative paths for database portability
- Plan 01-06: ProjectService manages project lifecycle (create, open, recent projects)
- Plan 01-06: .assetmap extension for databases (supports opening .db/.sqlite)
- Plan 01-06: Recent projects stored in localStorage (max 5)
- Plan 01-06: Default project location is %LOCALAPPDATA%\AssManger
- Plan 02-01: Curated 20 icon set from react-icons for better UX than full library
- Plan 02-01: react-colorful for lightweight color picker (2KB vs 10KB+ alternatives)
- Plan 02-01: Strict null types (string | null) match database schema for type safety
- Plan 02-01: MUI v5 Stack/Box simpler than Grid for form layouts
- Plan 02-02: ServiceResult pattern for consistent error handling across service methods
- Plan 02-02: Hierarchy validation at service layer using existing Location.canHaveChildType()
- Plan 02-02: Circular reference prevention via isDescendantOf() tree traversal
- Plan 02-03: SimpleTreeView for hierarchical location display (sufficient for basic hierarchy)
- Plan 02-03: Icon-per-type visual differentiation (Site/Building/Floor/Room icons)
- Plan 02-03: Selection-driven action buttons (Add Child/Edit/Delete based on selected node)
- Plan 02-03: Fixed child type when adding from parent context (prevents hierarchy violations)
- Plan 02-03: Error alerts for service layer validation failures (dismissible, persistent)

### Pending Todos

**Plan 01-01 prerequisite:**
- Install Rust toolchain (rustup.rs) to enable Tauri development
- Verify with: `rustc --version` and `cargo --version`
- Test with: `npm run tauri dev` (should open desktop window)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1 Foundation:**
- ✓ Normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0) implemented in entities (01-02) and schema (01-03)
- ✓ Repository abstraction complete (01-04) - ready for future PostgreSQL migration
- ✓ Cloud folder detection service complete (01-05) - OneDrive, Dropbox, SharePoint, Google Drive detection
- ✓ Coordinate transformation service ready for marker rendering (01-05)
- ✓ File storage with database-relative paths for portability (01-05)

**Phase 2 Location Hierarchy & Categories:**
- ✓ Category CRUD with icon/color visual attributes complete (02-01)
- ✓ MUI integration established for future UI components (02-01)
- ✓ Location hierarchy service layer with integrity checks complete (02-02)
- ✓ Visual location tree with interactive CRUD complete (02-03)
- ✓ MUI X TreeView integration for hierarchical navigation (02-03)

**Phase 5 Viewer Performance:**
- Canvas performance degradation expected with 500+ markers - requires viewport culling implementation
- Research suggests R-Tree spatial indexing may be needed for fast marker lookup

**Phase 7 Calibration Accuracy:**
- Two-point calibration UX must prevent user errors (clicking non-straight features, wrong units)
- Need sanity validation to catch unrealistic scales (e.g., 1 pixel = 100 meters)
